title: "reasearch of extinct blockchain working group"
---

There is a network of 10 people who are working at and taking care of the Warm house of relict blockchains. DAOs have already become not even parts of an ordinary life, but fossils and traces of financial technologies.

Everything is based on the fact that human beings evolve very slowly and the neural structures of the 2020 homo sapiens brain are similar to nowadays. Therefore, by replicating relationships with reconstructed economies and technologies, desires can be recreated as well. And the goal is to be a museum of economic desires that works with specific imaginations that are connected to industrial creativity.

The group of digital greenhouse keepers are dealing with financial technology as a cultural construct: they visit special tech courses, train in occupying extinct online platforms, experiment with aesthetics of "cognitive capitalism" era, do cybernetic morning exercises and test the influence of dreams on their bodies at night. The relations that they are reconstructing are real and they drag affects around them. A visitor of the greenhouse can see these dramas.
