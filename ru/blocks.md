Dasha is walking through the virtual botanical garden. She has joined a network of people who are taking care of dead blockchains, searching their stories and re-thinking their potentialities. She joined the group because she wants to redefine her philological background and to dive into the world of algorithms that she has always hardly understood. Part of the network visits different courses about technology of blockchain times. She would like to visit the course on mining as she heard a lot about the accidental sums of money that happened with her neighbours when she was a child (along with a huge bill for the electricity that they pay until now).

Along the way she gets inspired by wrapping things out with a plastic that was used to wrap the taxis in post-Soviet cities. As a larpist she wants to turn her home into the era of platform capitalism to better understand the interconnections between processes. She reads the reconstruction of someone's diary about that time: "I live in Minsk where the internet in some cafes ends 5 minutes before it's closed, where the account at my philological department works from 8am to 8pm when the sysadmin is at the Uni and where the new president candidate is the head of High Technology Park".

How could those contradictions live in one city - she thinks while preparing the home task for the next "mining session". She is thinking of a way to grow these mining instruments inside of the warmhouse of extinct blockchains.

The form is the larp of around 2 months that will happen online with a weekly gatherings in a digital orangery. It is a long larp because of ready-made courses on the spheres that are not very known to the participants and it should take some time to process.

"science-fiction of the present day" when all DAOs have already happened and blockchains
are "reptile" technologies. We need it to have a distant view on the processes in Belarusian tech&start-up sphere and to unpack emancipatory potentialities of not-only-project-oriented forms of collectivities

precarious situation, decentralization, lack of resources to do things "otherwise" than in the collective minimum mode when you work together only to accomplish the project

The goal of this warmhouse is to suspend and unpack the apparent neutrality and progressiveness of automated financial technologies

that is, in a specific locality - the post- Soviet community - to discuss what it means to introduce such tools into your practice

what does it mean to measure your success with instruments based not on care but on profit extructed from other localities, for example investment tools

what it means to create affinity groups that quantify their desires

someone's voice: "I wonder why the ratings and rewards were omnipresent? From our perspective, it looks like a banal tool of extraction, which is now not only illegal but also hard to imagine that someone will want to use it, because it does not cause anything apart from disgust. Even for a BDSM fetish, it is not suitable, unlike other economical strategies that are often practiced in BDSM clubs".
